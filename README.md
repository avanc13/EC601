Chord Classification in Polyphonic Music Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify chords in polyphonic music. By converting audio files into image representations based on chroma features and Pitch Class Profiles (PCP), it aims to identify major and minor chords within complex, multi-instrumental audio samples. It aslo uses mel spectograms as an input to a CNN. This work could support broader applications in music analysis and digital audio processing.

Project Goals
Develop a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between major and minor chords in polyphonic audio files.
Explore feature extraction techniques (e.g., chroma features and PCP) and evaluate different model architectures.
Address challenges in chord recognition within multi-instrumental settings where overlapping frequencies and harmonics are present.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled audio samples of major and minor chords. Audio data is organized into folders by chord type, which are preprocessed for feature extraction.
